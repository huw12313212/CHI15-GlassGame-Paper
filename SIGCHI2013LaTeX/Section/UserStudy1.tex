\section{User Study 1}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Process of gameplay
% \item User's feedback for existing games
% \item User's imagination
% \end{enumerate}

In order to realize the current game play experience on google glass. We use games currently existing on google glass to perform our user study. Furthermore, with a view to understanding the response and feedback for different control style and game content from users, we choose four games, ``Balance'', ``Shape Splitter'', ``Matcher'', and ``Clay Shooter'', with unique control type respectively(see Table~\ref{tab:gameControlTypes}).

We recruited 24 users(16 males and 8 females) with average 23.8 years old(std 3.96) and 13.9 years game experience(std 5.96).
To avoid bias caused by myopia, which might affect game expereience if you are not playing google glass with your own shortsight degree lens, we only recruited the user who don't have myopia or wearing contact lens. Moreover, all of our user has no experience wearing google glass before. 

About the process of our user study, we gave user five minutes to play each game, and filled in a questionnaire to understand the positive and negitive feedback from users after playing each game. To make results effective, the order of the game were counterbalanced to eliminate the effects of ordering. After playing all four games, we also provided a final questionnaire to realize the whole glass game play experience from users.

\subsection{User feedback}
We collect totally 304 feedback from users (141 positive feedback,163 negative feedback), after reviewing all feedback, we notice that some feedback is not glass related. For instance ,user might complain about the level design or visual art and admire to the innovative game design or good to listen music. so we categorized the feedback into 16 categories (see Table \ref{tab:issueType}).And we removed the feedback which are not related with glass and remain 131 feedback in the end(45 positive feedback,86 negative feedback). we summerize all feedback issue in Table \ref{tab:result1}. We can briefly divide all negative feedback into 6 main issue categories which are Gyro, In-Air Gesture, Voice control, Eye Tiring, Social Acceptable, Tapping.(see Figure~\ref{fig:negativeFeedback}).


\subsection{New issue with glass}
According to negative feedback from user (see Figure~\ref{fig:negativeFeedback}),the issue of Gyro, In-Air Gesture, Voice control and Tapping are all part of control issue. and we combine them as ``Limited control''. so we can conclude three new issues , ``Limited control'', ``Eye tiring'' and ``Social acceptable'' which are not exist in traditional game design.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Limited control : There is no affective powerful gaming input like mouse, keyboard, joystick or touch screen on google glass. There are some non-traditional gaming input like camera, small touch pad, microphone, gyroscope, accelerometer. How to use these new control in glass game design is still an open question.

\item Eye tiring : Not like traditional gaming platform, playing game with glass need more intence of eye muscle, and user report that it is really easy to feel eye tiring. So game design with google glass should control the gaming duration really carefully, focusing on glass in a long time is not practical.

\item Social acceptable : Although we can use voice control and in-air gesture on google glass, we have to use them carefully, and check if our control scheme is social acceptable.

\end{enumerate}


%And we can briefly divide the negative feedback into 6 main issue categories``Limited control'', ``Eye tiring'' and ``Social acceptable''(see Figure~\ref{fig:negativeFeedback}), which are not exist in traditional game design.

%\subsection{Observation}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item NOT social acceptable != NOT fun
% \item Small movement is better
% \end{enumerate}
%From user feedback, although social acceptable would make an influence on glass game play experience, most users still think game play experience is fun and interesting. With this condition, we can conclude that social acceptable is independent to the level of fun and enjoyment. In other words, if a game has low social acceptable rate, it does not mean the game is not fun or users don't like it. In addition, we also find that small movement interacting with google glass is better and more perferred for users. 


\subsection{User imagination}
After playing all four games,in our final interview we also asked users to imagine what kind of games on google glass will they like the most and why. With the previous gaming experience in user study 1, they brought up thirty-seven insteresting glass game idea in total. We divided them into six types of game, ``First-Person Shooter'', ``Reality Puzzle Game'', ``Social Game'', ``Sport Game'', ``Management Game'', and ``Others'' respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig:US1_TypesOfGame}). We found that one-third of users want like first-person shooter game the most. We list the reason why users think these type of game is suitable for google glass.

 

\begin{enumerate}
\item FPS : They think google glass is a native first-person view, will be really suitable for First-Person Shooter. And some of user imagine that they can use mobile phone, which is always connected with glass, as an input device(with gun metaphor) to extend the limited input power.

\item Reality Puzzle Game : Some user suggest not focusing on glass screen, we can focus on the real world. Like playing reality puzzle game, player can get hint from google glass, but player doesn't need to focus on glass screen all the time. 

\item Sport Game : Users think google glass can be a gamification tool for sport. It's a see-through screen, we can check google glass even though on exercising. Google Glass can analyze GPS or accelerometer information to give the player reward message to make exercising more fun and enjoyment.

\item Social Game : To be continued.....

\item Management Game : With the characteristic of Always-On, Users think google glass is really suitable for management game(or Pet-Nurturing Game).Player can check the game status any time with a glance, and doing some simple command with tapping. And these type of game is short gaming period, doesn't need heavy control.

\end{enumerate}


%After playing all four games,in our final interview we also asked users to imagine what kind of games on google glass will they like the most in user study 1. With existing glass game scene and users' originality, they brought up thirty-seven interesting glass game scenario in total. We divided them into six types of game, ``First-Person Shooter'', ``Reality Puzzle Game'', ``Social Game'', ``Sport Game'', ``Management Game'', and ``Others'' respectively (see Figure~\ref{fig:US1_TypesOfGame}). We also found that one-third of users want like first-person shooter game the most. So we decided to implement a first-person shooter game which will support multiple types of control style for users. With this design, not only users can choose which control type they like the most by their own, but we also can find out the best control style from users' feedback for first-person game on google glass and design a guideline to make better game play experience.
